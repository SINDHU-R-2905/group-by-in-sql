1.Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.

                             CITY
field------------------------------------------------------------type
1.id                                                             1.number
2.name                                                           2.varchar2(17)
3.CountryCode                                                    3.varchar2(3)
4.district                                                       4.varchar2(20)
5.population                                                     5.number

SELECT MAX(POPULATION) - MIN(POPULATION)AS population_difference
FROM CITY;


2.Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle

CREATE TABLE TRAINGLES(
  A INT,
  B INT,
  C INT
);
INSERT INTO TRAINGLES('A','B','C')VALUES
(20,20,23),
(20,20,20),
(20,21,22),
(13,14,33);
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
  END AS Triangle_Type
FROM TRAINGLES;


3.Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  n is odd, print Weird 
If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5 , print Not Weird 
If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  6 to 20 , print Weird 
If  n is even and greater than  20 , print Not Weird 
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not   n is weird.


import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        if (N % 2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Weird");
        } else if (N >= 2 && N <= 5) {
            System.out.println("Not Weird");
        } else if (N >= 6 && N <= 20) {
            System.out.println("Weird");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not Weird");
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
