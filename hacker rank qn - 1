1.Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

        field-----------------------------------tytpe
  1.ID                                         1.NUMBER
  2.NAME                                       2.VARCHAR2(17)
  3.COUNTRYCODE                                3.VARCHAR2(3)
  4.DISTRICT                                   4.VARCHAR2(30)
  5.POPULATION                                 5.NUMBER


 SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE CountryCode = 'USA' AND Population > 100000;


2.Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

                           city
        field-----------------------------------tytpe
  1.ID                                         1.NUMBER
  2.NAME                                       2.VARCHAR2(17)
  3.COUNTRYCODE                                3.VARCHAR2(3)
  4.DISTRICT                                   4.VARCHAR2(30)
  5.POPULATION                                 5.NUMBER


(
  SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
  FROM STATION
  ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
  LIMIT 1
)
UNION
(
  SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAME_LENGTH
  FROM STATION
  ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
  LIMIT 1
);


3.Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

                           city
        field-----------------------------------tytpe
  1.ID                                         1.NUMBER
  2. CITY                                      2.VARCHAR2(21)
  3.STATE                                      3.VARCHAR2(2)
  4.LAT_N                                      4.NUMBER
  5.LONG_W                                     5.NUMBER


SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '[aeiou]$';



4.Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.



                              city
        field-----------------------------------tytpe
  1.ID                                         1.NUMBER
  2. CITY                                      2.VARCHAR2(21)
  3.STATE                                      3.VARCHAR2(2)
  4.LAT_N                                      4.NUMBER
  5.LONG_W                                     5.NUMBER


SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';
